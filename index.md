- I'm an MS student in AI at Yonsei University, advised by Professor [Dongha Lee](https://donalee.github.io/) in the [DLI Lab](https://dli.yonsei.ac.kr/). Previously, I received my BS in Physics and Computer Science from Sogang University.
- I'm interested in anything that helps thinking machines think deeper. To my current understanding, this includes **instilling reasoning abilities** by demonstrating good reasoning traces -- ones that exhibit dense, transparent, and well-structured exploration and reflection of thoughts -- as well as **eliciting reasoning capacities** hidden within pretrained models by letting them learn from experience through interaction with carefully designed environments, often drawing inspiration from cognitive processes of the human mind.
