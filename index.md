## Research Interests
- I’m interested in anything that helps thinking machines think deeper.
- To my current understanding, this includes instilling reasoning abilities through supervised fine-tuning on good reasoning traces -- ones that exhibit dense, transparent, and well-structured exploration and exploitation of thoughts -- as well as eliciting reasoning capacities hidden within pretrained models and extending reasoning sequences to better leverage test-time compute scaling, often drawing inspiration from cognitive processes of the human mind.
