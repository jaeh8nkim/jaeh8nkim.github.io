- I'm an MS student in AI at Yonsei University, advised by Professor [Dongha Lee](https://donalee.github.io/).
- ✨ hydrogen and helium → ⭐ stars → 🌏 earth → 👫 humans → 👣 giants → ⚡🧠 intelligence

## Timeline
- MS in Artificial Intelligence, Yonsei University (Expected Aug 2027)
- BS in Physics and Computer Science, Sogang University (Aug 2025)

## Research Interests
- I’m interested in anything that helps thinking machines think deeper.
- To my current understanding, this includes instilling reasoning abilities through supervised fine-tuning on good reasoning traces -- ones that exhibit dense, transparent, and well-structured exploration and exploitation of thoughts -- as well as eliciting reasoning capacities hidden within pretrained models and extending reasoning sequences to better leverage test-time compute scaling, often drawing inspiration from cognitive processes of the human mind.
