- I'm an MS student in AI at Yonsei University, advised by Professor [Dongha Lee](https://donalee.github.io/). Previously, I received my BS in Physics and Computer Science from Sogang University.
- I’m interested in anything that helps thinking machines think deeper. To my current understanding, this includes instilling reasoning abilities through supervised fine-tuning on good reasoning traces -- ones that exhibit dense, transparent, and well-structured exploration and exploitation of thoughts -- as well as eliciting reasoning capacities hidden within pretrained models and extending reasoning sequences to better leverage test-time compute scaling, often drawing inspiration from cognitive processes of the human mind.
